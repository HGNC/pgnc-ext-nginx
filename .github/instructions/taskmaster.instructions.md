# Taskmaster Tool & Command Reference

This document provides a detailed reference for interacting with Taskmaster, covering both the recommended MCP tools, suitable for integrations like VS Code, and the corresponding `task-master` CLI commands, designed for direct user interaction or fallback.

**Note:** For interacting with Taskmaster programmatically or via integrated tools, using the **MCP tools is strongly recommended** due to better performance, structured data, and error handling. The CLI commands serve as a user-friendly alternative and fallback. 

**Important:** Several MCP tools involve AI processing... The AI-powered tools include `parse_prd`, `analyze_project_complexity`, `update_subtask`, `update_task`, `update`, `expand_all`, `expand_task`, and `add_task`.

**3c7 Tagged Task Lists System:** Task Master now supports **tagged task lists** for multi-context task management. This allows you to maintain separate, isolated lists of tasks for different features, branches, or experiments. Existing projects are seamlessly migrated to use a default "master" tag. Most commands now support a `--tag <name>` flag to specify which context to operate on. If omitted, commands use the currently active tag.
